# Walking-School-Buses

This project is a prototype of an interactive vest for children to wear, while walking to school in a group (The concept known as Walking School Bus). The prototype consists of a master vest, worn by an adult guide, and a vest for the children. The vest worn by the children can be checked-in by placing an RFID tag from the vest on a specific spot on the guide's vest. Incorporated LEDs on the vests light up to both show if a child has been checked in to the school bus, and also serves as a safety device, to make the children more visible in the dark.
